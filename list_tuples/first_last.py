Write a function, firstlast, that takesa  sequence  (string,  list,  or  tuple)  
and  returns  the  first  and  last  elements  of  thatsequence,  in  a  two-element  
sequence  of  the  same  type.  
So firstlast('abc')  willreturn the string ac, while firstlast([1,2,3,4]) will return the list [1,4]

Write a function that takes a list or tuple of numbers. 
Return a two-element list,containing (respectively) the sum of the even-indexed numbers and the sum ofthe odd-indexed numbers. 
So calling the function as even_odd_sums([10,20,30,40,50,60]), youâ€™ll get back [90,120].
